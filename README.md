This is a website project for Web Development 2 class. This website allows the user to match up two action movie stars and pit them against each other. Their outcome is based on the number of people they've killed in movies, and the number of times they've died in movies. Each time an actor wins a match, the get an HP multiplier, making them even more dangerous in future matches.
